// Standalone emulators the shell can find on its own.
//
// Two reasons a platform ends up here. RetroAchievements only recognises the
// standalone PCSX2 and Dolphin, not their libretro cores, so for PS2 and
// GameCube/Wii there is no core that will ever unlock an achievement. PS3 and
// Wii U are simpler still: libretro has no core for either, so RetroArch cannot
// play them at all and RPCS3 and Cemu are the only way they launch.
//
// The emulators config has always been able to point at all four; what nobody
// can reasonably do is guess the executable name and argument template, which
// is the part that keeps people stuck.
//
// So this is the same idea as detecting RetroArch, extended: probe the usual
// locations, and launch what is there. It carries no downloading and no
// configuration writing -- an emulator installed by any means, a package
// manager or a frontend's own tree, is found the same way.
//
// Platform, home and environment are parameters rather than read from the
// process, so all three platforms' paths can be exercised from any machine.
